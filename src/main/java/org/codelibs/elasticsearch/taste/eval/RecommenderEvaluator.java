     * The range of values that may be returned depends on the implementation, but <em>lower</em> values must
     * mean better recommendations, with 0 being the lowest / best possible evaluation, meaning a perfect match.
     * This method does not accept a {@link org.codelibs.elasticsearch.taste.recommender.Recommender} directly, but

     * Implementations will take a certain percentage of the preferences supplied by the given {@link DataModel}
     * as "training data". This is typically most of the data, like 90%. This data is used to produce
     * recommendations, and the rest of the data is compared against estimated preference values to see how much
     * the {@link org.codelibs.elasticsearch.taste.recommender.Recommender}'s predicted preferences match the user's
     * real preferences. Specifically, for each user, this percentage of the user's ratings are used to produce
     * recommendations, and for each user, the remaining preferences are compared against the user's real
     * preferences.

     *
     * <p>
     * For large datasets, it may be desirable to only evaluate based on a small percentage of the data.
     * {@code evaluationPercentage} controls how many of the {@link DataModel}'s users are used in
     * evaluation.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * To be clear, {@code trainingPercentage} and {@code evaluationPercentage} are not related. They
     * do not need to add up to 1.0, for example.
